## Creating an HDS Stream

From the local streams in EMS, issue the **`createHDSStream`** command:

``` 
createHDSStream localstreamnames=myStream targetfolder=[../webroot/path] groupname=myHdsGroup
```

To use multiple `localStreamNames` using one **`createHDSStream`** command do the following:

``` 
createHDSStream localstreamnames=myStream1,myStream2,myStream3 targetFolder=[../webroot/path] groupName=myHdsGroup
```

The created files will automatically save in the `targetFolder` path.

``` 
../evo-webroot/
myHdsGroup/
  myStream/
    bootstrap
    myStream.f4m
    f4vSegxx-Fragxx
  manifest.f4m
  manifest_v1.f4m
```



## Playing an HDS Manifest File

The corresponding link to play this stream would then be:

``` 
http://192.168.100.35:8888/myHdsGroup/manifest.f4m
```

This URL breaks down to: `http://<EMS IP Address>:<Web Server Port>/<HDS Group Name>/<Subfolder>/<manifest file name>`
