### Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)

#### Creating a DASH Stream

From the local streams in EMS, issue the **createDASHStream** command:

    createDASHStream localstreamnames=myStream targetfolder=[../webroot/path] groupname=myDashGroup

To use multiple localStreamNames using one **createDASHStream** command do the following:

    createDASHStream localstreamnames=myStream1,myStream2,myStream3 targetFolder=[../webroot/path] groupName=myDashGroup

The created files will automatically save in the targetFolder path.

    ../evo-webroot/
      myDashGroup/
        myStream1/
          audio/
            (bitrate)/
              seg_init.mp4
              segment_xx.m4s
          video/
            (bitrate)/
              seg_init.mp4
              segment_xx.m4s
        manifest.mpd

#### Playing a DASH Manifest File

The corresponding link to play this stream would then be:

    http://<EWS_IP_ADDRESS>:8888/myDashGroup/manifest.mpd

This URL breaks down to: http:// My Web Server / DASH Group Name / manifest file name
