## Creating a DASH Stream

From the local streams in EMS, issue the **`createDASHStream`** command:

``` 
createDASHStream localstreamnames=myStream targetfolder=[../webroot/path] groupname=myDashGroup
```

To use multiple `localStreamNames` using one **`createDASHStream`** command do the following:

``` 
createDASHStream localstreamnames=myStream1,myStream2,myStream3 targetFolder=[../webroot/path] groupName=myDashGroup
```

The created files will automatically save in the `targetFolder` path.

``` 
../evo-webroot/
  myDashGroup/
    myStream1/
      audio/
        (bitrate)/
          seg_init.mp4
          segment_xx.m4s
      video/
        (bitrate)/
          seg_init.mp4
          segment_xx.m4s
    manifest.mpd
```



## Playing a DASH Manifest File

The corresponding link to play this stream would then be:

``` 
http://192.168.100.35:8888/myDashGroup/manifest.mpd
```

This URL breaks down to: `http://<EMS IP Address>:<Web Server Port>/<DASH Group Name>/<manifest file name>`
