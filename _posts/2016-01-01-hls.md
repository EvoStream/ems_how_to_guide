## Creating an HLS Stream

From the local streams in EMS, issue the **`createHLSStream`** command:

``` 
createHLSStream localstreamnames=myStream targetfolder=[../webroot/path] groupname=myHlsGroup
```

To use multiple `localStreamNames` using one **`createHLSStream`** command do the following:

``` 
createHLSStream localstreamnames=myStream1,myStream2,myStream3 targetFolder=[../webroot/path] groupName=myHlsGroup
```

The created files will automatically save in the `targetFolder` path.

``` 
../evo-webroot/
  myHlsGroup/
    myStream1/
      segmentxx.ts
      playlist.m3u8 (childplaylist)
  playlist.m3u8 (masterplaylist)
```



## Playing an HLS Playlist File

The corresponding link to use on Safari to play this stream would then be:

``` 
http://192.168.100.35:8888/myHlsGroup/playlist.m3u8
```

This URL breaks down to: `http://<EMS IP Address>:<Web Server Port>/<HLS Group Name>/<Subfolder>/<playlist file name>`
