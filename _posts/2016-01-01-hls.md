### HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)

#### Creating an HLS Stream

From the local streams in EMS, issue the **createHLSStream** command:

    createHLSStream localstreamnames=myStream targetfolder=[../webroot/path] groupname=myHlsGroup

To use multiple localStreamNames using one **createHLSStream** command do the following:

    createHLSStream localstreamnames=myStream1,myStream2,myStream3 targetFolder=[../webroot/path] groupName=myHlsGroup

The created files will automatically save in the targetFolder path.

    ../evo-webroot/
      myHlsGroup/
        myStream1/
          segmentxx.ts
          playlist.m3u8 (childplaylist)
      playlist.m3u8 (masterplaylist)

#### Playing an HLS Playlist File

The corresponding link to use on Safari to play this stream would then be:

    http://<EWS_IP_ADDRESS>:8888/myHlsGroup/playlist.m3u8

This URL breaks down to: http:// My Web Server / HLS Group Name / Subfolder / playlist file name
