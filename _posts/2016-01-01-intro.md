| **TERM** | **DEFINITION**                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| API      | Application Programming Interface        |
| ASCII    | American Standard Code for Information Interchange |
| DASH     | Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP     |
| EMS      | EvoStream Media Server                   |
| ERS      | EvoStream Rendezvous Server              |
| EWS      | EvoStream Web Server                     |
| FLV      | Flash Video                              |
| HDS      | HTTP Dynamic Streaming                   |
| HLS      | HTTP Live Streaming                      |
| HTTP     | Hypertext Transfer Protocol              |
| IDR      | Instantaneous Decoding Refresh - This is a specific packet in the H.264 video encoding specification. It is a full snapshot of the video at a specific instance (one full frame). Video players require an IDR frame to start playing any video. "Frames" that occur between IDR Frames are simply offsets/differences from the first IDR. |
| IIS      | Internet Information Services            |
| JSON     | JavaScript Object Notation               |
| lua      | A lightweight multi-paradigm programming language |
| MOV      | MPEG 4 video container file format used in Apple's QuickTime program |
| MPEG     | Moving Picture Experts Group             |
| MPEG-TS  | MPEG Transport Stream                    |
| MP4      | A digital multimedia format most commonly used to store video and audio |
| MSS      | Microsoft Smooth Streaming               |
| OSMF     | Open Source Media Framework              |
| RTCP     | Real Time Control Protocol - An protocol that is typically used with RTSP to synchronize two RTP streams, often audio and video streams |
| RTMP     | Real Time Messaging Protocol - Used with Adobe Flash players |
| RTMPT    | Real Time Messaging Protocol Tunneled - Essentially RTMP over HTTP |
| RTP      | Real Time Protocol - A simple protocol used to stream data, typically audio or video data. |
| RTSP     | Real Time Streaming Protocol - Used with Android devices and live streaming clients like VLC or QuickTime. RTSP does not actually transport the audio/video data; it is simply a negotiation protocol. It is normally paired with a protocol like RTP, which will handle the actual data transport. |
| swfURL   | Used in the RTMP protocol, this field is used to designate the URL/address of the Adobe Flash Applet being used to generate the stream (if any). |
| SDP      | Session Description Protocol file        |
| tcURL    | Used in the RTMP protocol, this field is used to designate the URL/address of the originating stream server. |
| URI      | Universal Resource Identifier. The generic form of a "URL". URI's are used to specify the location and type of streams. |
| VOD      | Video On Demand                          |

## Purpose

This document is intended for Engineers and System Integrators. It provides descriptions of common EvoStream Media Server (EMS) functionality as well as example commands to achieve that functionality.

It augments the EMS Application Programming Interface (API) Definition document. Familiarization with EMS API is recommended before proceeding with this How To document.

The sample commands provided in this document refer to API calls that can be made to either the ASCII (telnet) or the HTTP interfaces. These example commands can be copied and modified to meet the project's needs.

Please see the EMS API Definition document for instructions on using the ASCII or HTTP interfaces, further descriptions of these commands and for optional function parameters not used in the preceding examples.

## Recommended Players

Any players that natively support the target protocol will work with EMS.

Below are the recommend players for the following protocols and delivery formats that are compatible with EMS.
