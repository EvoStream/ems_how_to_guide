There will likely come a time where stopping a stream is needed. There are two general types of streams: Inbound Streams and Outbound Streams. The convention being used for the direction is always from the perspective of the EMS. So therefore an Inbound Stream can also be considered a source stream.

**Notes:**

- Inbound Streams have both a `localStreamName` and an ID.
  
- Outbound Streams have only an ID.
  
  -	Stopping an Inbound Stream will automatically shut down all associated Outbound Streams.



## shutdownStream

There are two functions provided for stopping streams: **shutdownStream** and **`removeConfig`**

**shutdownStream** is intended for doing just what it says, shutting down a stream. By setting the permanently parameter to true, `shutdownStream` will also remove the configuration entry (if one exists) in the pullPushConfig.xml file.

``` 
shutdownStream localstreamname=RTSPTest
```

or  

``` 
shutdownStream id=333 permanently=0
```



## removeConfig

**`removeConfig`** is intended to remove the entry in pullPushConfig.xml, but it will also stop the associated stream.

``` 
removeConfig id=22
```

**Note:**  The stream ID is not the same as the config ID. The `listStreams` command shows stream IDs. The `listConfig` command shows configuration IDs.
